# What is a hook 

A hook is a custom script that automatically fires when certain actions occur. 

Actions such as commiting and merging fire client-side hooks. 

You can write a hook in bash, perl, ruby, python, or any other scripting language. 

If you run `git init` git will add examples to the hooks directory  `git/hooks`.

For example, the hook called `post-commit` is useful for sending an email notifaction when there has been a new commit.
