# Useful commit hooks

Two useful hooks which fire during a commit are `pre-commit` and `post-commit`.

`pre-commit` 

This hook runs before you even type in a commit message. you can use it to check the changes you're about to make. 

`post-commit`

This hook fires when the commit process ends. You can use it to send an email notifaction to the team about the new commit.
