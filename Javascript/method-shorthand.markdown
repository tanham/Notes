# Method Shorthand

ES6 method shorthand allows us remove the function key word and colon making code more succinct. 

For example prior to ES6 you would have written something similiar to the below: 

```javascript 
return {
	func: function func() {
	...
	}
};
```

With ES6 this can now become: 

```javascript 
return {
	func() {
	...
	}
};
```
